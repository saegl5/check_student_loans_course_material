Open each PDF file with Acrobat Reader DC (https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/pdf-reader.html).

Each file consists of an introductory script, app overview, course material and feedback template.
"Informal Pilot Test.pdf," "Focus Groups.pdf," and "Panel Discussion.pdf" also begin with a script for inviting subjects/experts to participate in the study.

Instructional App = course material + Android/iOS app

How to Replicate Any Portion of the Study
----------------------------------------------

Invite subjects/experts to participate in the study.
When one meets with the participants, follow the introductory script. Keep the app overview for personal reference.
Course material is distributed to subjects/experts for them to complete. However, do not simply hand them the material; illustrate some examples briefly.
Once subjects/experts are done, ask them to provide feedback.
